# 🌩️ CloudProfile — MERN + DevOps + AI Integrated Web App

CloudProfile is a **full-stack MERN-based cloud web application** that combines **modern web development**, **CI/CD automation**, and **cloud deployment** — showcasing complete **Full-Stack + DevOps** skills.

> Currently, the **Frontend** and **CI/CD integration** are completed. The **Backend** and **AI integration** will be added soon.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal of **CloudProfile** is to demonstrate how a MERN application can be integrated with **GitLab CI/CD**, **Docker**, **AWS**, and **AI assistants** — creating a modern, automated, and intelligent cloud-based deployment workflow.

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js *(in progress)*  
- **Database:** MongoDB  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Web Server:** Nginx  
- **Cloud Services:** AWS EC2 (deployment) + S3 (storage)  
- **CI/CD:** GitLab CI/CD  
- **AI Assistant:** AI Project Assistant *(planned feature)*

## 🛠️ DevOps & Deployment Workflow

1. **Code Commit:** Changes pushed to GitLab trigger CI/CD pipeline  
2. **CI Pipeline:** Builds frontend → runs tests → generates production build  
3. **Dockerization:** Application packaged into a Docker container  
4. **Deployment:** Deployed automatically on **AWS EC2** with **Nginx reverse proxy**  
5. **Static Assets:** Managed via **AWS S3**
