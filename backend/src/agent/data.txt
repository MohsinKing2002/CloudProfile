CloudProfile — MERN + DevOps + AI Integrated Web App

CloudProfile is a full-stack MERN-based cloud web application that combines modern web development, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployment — showcasing complete Full-Stack + DevOps skills.

Currently, the Frontend and CI/CD integration are completed. The Backend and AI integration will be added soon.

---

Project Overview

The goal of CloudProfile is to demonstrate how a MERN application can be integrated with GitLab CI/CD, Docker, AWS, and AI assistants — creating a modern, automated, and intelligent cloud-based deployment workflow.

Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS  
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js (in progress)  
- Database: MongoDB  
- Containerization: Docker  
- Web Server: Nginx  
- Cloud Services: AWS EC2 (deployment) + S3 (storage)  
- CI/CD: GitLab CI/CD  
- AI Assistant: AI Project Assistant (planned feature)

Key Features

- CRUD Functionalities: Signup, login, create, update, and delete user profiles  
- Dark/Light Theme Toggle: Enhanced UI experience  
- Automated CI/CD Pipeline: Fully integrated using GitLab CI/CD  
- Modular Architecture: Separate frontend and backend structure  
- AI Integration: Ask queries like:
  "What technologies are used in this project?",
  "Can you explain the project’s main features?",
  "What CI/CD tools are used?",
  "Can you describe the project architecture?",
- Cloud Deployment: Dockerized setup with Nginx on AWS

DevOps & Deployment Workflow

1. Code Commit: Changes pushed to GitLab trigger CI/CD pipeline  
2. CI Pipeline: Builds frontend → runs tests → generates production build  
3. Dockerization: Application packaged into a Docker container  
4. Deployment: Deployed automatically on AWS EC2 with Nginx reverse proxy  
5. Static Assets: Managed via AWS S3
